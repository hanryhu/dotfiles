# dotfiles


These are my Dotfiles.

- `slushy` is a Ubuntu (14?) dual-boot machine.
- `wainux` is my Ubuntu 20 dual-boot machine.
- `snowflake` is my Macbook Pro
- `csail` are the Linux boxes of the Infolab group at
[CSAIL](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/infolab/)
- `racecar` is a Linux box attached to a robot used for 6.141:
Robotics at MIT.
- `devbox` represents a generic remote Linux box that is only used in nw
  for commits, etc. (Tramp from an ordinary box is used as the
  primary emacs). This config avoids depending on .emacs.d (i.e., zenburn,
  start-common).
