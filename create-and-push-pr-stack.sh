Looks for empty commits since origin/master and uses them to
create/update stacked branches at origin automatically.

You can use this by doing what
<redacted>
says, except create empty commits using 'git commit --allow-empty -m
"[stack-name] [n/N] description"' to mark boundaries between your
desired stacked PRs.  This allows you to automatically rebase and
force-push the PRs in a stack whenever you make changes to the middle
of the stack.

To migrate any large code change into a string of updatable stacked
branches:

1. Checkout your XL branch
2. Make a bunch of empty commits
3. Use git fetch origin master ; git rebase -i origin/master and move the commits around
4. Call create-and-push-pr-stack.sh

When you make changes in the middle of your stack, you can create
commits at the top of your master stack and then send them down via
git rebase -i origin/master.  If it leads to merge conflicts
(especially if new files are being added), you can either resolve them
normally or splinter your commits into smaller fixups before rebasing,
allowing the smaller commits to stop and fixup at different points
when you rebase down the stack (like chromatography).  To split up a
commit into multiple commits, give it "edit" mode during a rebase, and
use git reset HEAD^; git add -p ; git commit [--reuse-message SHA],
repeatedly.

When you land the bottom of your stack into master and fetch+rebase,
you have at least three choices to avoid conflicts between your
unsquashed bottom and its squashed copy on master: (1) drop the shared
commits manually during rebase; (2) squash commits manually during
rebase; or (3) keep only one commit per stacked branch.

  create-and-push-pr-stack.sh
