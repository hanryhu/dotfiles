# * PREFIX
set   -g prefix C-z
unbind C-b # unbind the default binding to send prefix key to the application
# Often you'll run a tmux inside another tmux and need a command sequence to
# send things to the inner session. With below binding that can be accomplished
# using "PREFIX Z <command>"
bind   Z send-prefix

# * Source config
unbind r # unbind default binding to force redraw of attached client
bind   r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "Finished sourcing ~/.tmux.conf ."
